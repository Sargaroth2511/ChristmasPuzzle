# Documentation Cleanup Analysis - October 7, 2025

## Obsolete Files (Can Be Removed)

These files document the old **@angular/localize** approach which has been **completely replaced** by **@ngx-translate**:

### ‚ùå 1. I18N_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- **Reason**: Documents @angular/localize setup with .xlf files
- **Status**: OBSOLETE - We removed @angular/localize
- **Replacement**: RUNTIME_LANGUAGE_SWITCHING.md
- **Action**: DELETE and remove from git

### ‚ùå 2. I18N_QUICK_START.md  
- **Reason**: Quick start guide for @angular/localize
- **Status**: OBSOLETE - References messages.xlf and build:de/build:en scripts

### ‚ùå 3. TESTING_LANGUAGE_SUPPORT.md

- **Status**: OBSOLETE - References extract-i18n, build:de commands

- **Action**: DELETE and remove from git

### ‚ùå 4. LANGUAGE_ROUTING_SOLUTION.md
- **Reason**: Routing solutions for compile-time i18n (separate builds per language)

### ‚ùå 5. LANGUAGE_SUPPORT_SUMMARY.md

git rm I18N_IMPLEMENTATION.md
git rm I18N_QUICK_START.md
git rm TESTING_LANGUAGE_SUPPORT.md
