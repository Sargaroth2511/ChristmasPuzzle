# Collision Bug Fix - Static Body Issue

## 🐛 The Bug

Pieces were **not colliding** when dragged in Matter.js mode, even though they had Matter bodies.

## 🔍 Root Cause

**Line 1818-1820 in puzzle.scene.ts:**
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - This prevented collisions!
this.matter.body.setStatic(matterBody, true);
```

### Why This Was Wrong:

In Matter.js physics:
- **Static bodies** = immovable, infinite mass, **don't collide with other dynamic bodies**
- **Dynamic bodies** = movable, finite mass, **do collide with each other**

By setting the dragged piece to `static`, we:
- ✅ Prevented it from falling due to gravity
- ❌ **Prevented it from colliding with other pieces!**

## ✅ The Fix

### Change 1: Remove Static Setting
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Keep body dynamic for collisions
// Don't set to static - we want collisions!
// We'll manually update position and velocity in the drag handler
```

### Change 2: Manual Position Control
```typescript
// Forcefully set position (overrides physics, prevents gravity effect)
this.matter.body.setPosition(matterBody, { x: piece.shape.x, y: piece.shape.y });

// Apply velocity for collision detection
this.matter.body.setVelocity(matterBody, { 
  x: velocityX * 0.2,  // Stronger collisions
  y: velocityY * 0.2 
});
```

### How This Works:

1. **Keep body dynamic** → Enables collisions
2. **Manually set position** → Overrides gravity, piece follows mouse
3. **Apply velocity** → Matter.js detects collisions based on this velocity
4. **Other pieces react** → Physics engine calculates collision response

### Change 3: Increased Collision Strength

Changed velocity multiplier from **0.1 to 0.2** for more noticeable collisions.

## 🎮 Result

Now when you:
1. **Enable Matter.js mode** (physics toggle button)
2. **Drag a piece quickly** toward another piece
3. **The other piece gets pushed away!** 🎉

### Collision Strength Guide:
- **Slow drag** = gentle nudge
- **Medium drag** = noticeable push
- **Fast drag** = strong shove

## 🧪 Testing

### Before Fix:
```
[Drag Collision] Piece has Matter body - collision detection active during drag
// But pieces just passed through each other 😞
```

### After Fix:
```
[Drag Collision] Piece has Matter body - collision detection active during drag
// Pieces actually push each other! 🎉
```

### Console Commands to Test:

```javascript
// Check if body is static (should be false)
game.scene.scenes[0].pieces[0].matterBody.isStatic
// Expected: false

// Check if body can collide
game.scene.scenes[0].pieces[0].matterBody.collisionFilter
// Should show: { category: 1, mask: 65535 }
```

## 📝 Key Lesson

**In Matter.js:**
- Static bodies are for **walls, floors, and fixed obstacles**
- Dynamic bodies are for **moving, interacting objects**
- You **CAN** manually control a dynamic body's position (what we do)
- But you **CANNOT** make a static body collide with other static bodies

Our solution: **Dynamic body + manual position control = best of both worlds!**

## 🚀 Next Steps

Try it now:
1. Reload the page
2. Click "Enable Matter.js Physics"
3. Drag a piece **fast** into another piece
4. Watch it push the other piece away!

The faster you drag, the harder the collision! 💥
