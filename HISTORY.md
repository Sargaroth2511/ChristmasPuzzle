# Session 019984c2-b9bf-7c62-be6e-138568d56488

## Summary
- Parsed `ClientApp/src/assets/pieces/Zeichnung.svg` at runtime to generate puzzle geometry, replacing the placeholder star.
- Normalized the SVG coordinates to fit the Phaser board uniformly and clamped scatter positions to keep pieces within view.
- Removed snapping so pieces stay draggable for debugging while retaining hover highlights.
- Restyled pieces with transparent fills and black outlines for a frosted-glass look aligned with the new page palette.
- Added a “Show/Hide Guides” toggle that controls the drag overlay while leaving the outline always visible.
- Updated global styling to a frosty background to complement the new visuals.

## Notes
- Snapping remains disabled; revisit once geometry and UX are finalized.
- `samplePath` currently samples at ~4px intervals; adjust if higher fidelity is required.
