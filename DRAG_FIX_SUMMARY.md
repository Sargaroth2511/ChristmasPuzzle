# Drag Not Working - Fix Summary

## Problem
After implementing Matter.js collision physics, pieces were not draggable after the explosion animation completed.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the **explosion settling detection** in the `updateExplosionWithMatter()` method. The thresholds for determining when pieces had "settled" were too strict:

### Original (Too Strict):
```typescript
speed < 0.01          // Speed threshold too low
angularSpeed < 0.01   // Angular speed too low  
nearGround = bounds.bottom >= floorLimit - 10  // Too close to exact floor
```

### Problems:
1. **Speed thresholds too low**: With Matter.js friction and bouncing, pieces might never reach such low velocities
2. **Ground detection too precise**: Pieces might be resting at various heights due to stacking
3. **All conditions required**: ALL three had to be true simultaneously, making it nearly impossible to satisfy

This meant:
- The explosion never completed (`explosionComplete` stayed `false`)
- `preparePiecesForPuzzle()` was never called
- Pieces were never made draggable
- The game was stuck in "explosion mode"

## Solution

### 1. **Relaxed Settling Thresholds**
```typescript
speed < 0.05          // 5x more lenient (was 0.01)
angularSpeed < 0.05   // 5x more lenient (was 0.01)
nearGround = bounds.bottom >= floorLimit - 50  // 5x more lenient (was -10)
```

### 2. **Added Debug Logging**
Added console logs to track:
- Explosion progress: `X/Y pieces settled`
- When explosion completes
- When `preparePiecesForPuzzle()` is called
- When pieces are made draggable
- When drag events are triggered

This helps diagnose future issues immediately.

### 3. **Fixed Matter Body Cleanup**
Improved the handling when Matter bodies are removed:
```typescript
if (!matterBody) {
  // Count as settled if piece is no longer exploding
  if (!piece.exploding) {
    settledCount += 1;
  }
  return;
}
```

## Expected Console Output (Normal Flow)

```
[Explosion Progress] 1/12 pieces settled
[Explosion Progress] 3/12 pieces settled
[Explosion Progress] 7/12 pieces settled
[Explosion Progress] 12/12 pieces settled
[Explosion Complete] All 12 pieces settled, transitioning to puzzle phase
[preparePiecesForPuzzle] Starting puzzle preparation
[preparePiecesForPuzzle] Gravity disabled
[preparePiecesForPuzzle] Piece 0 made draggable, interactive: true
[preparePiecesForPuzzle] Piece 1 made draggable, interactive: true
...
[preparePiecesForPuzzle] Piece 11 made draggable, interactive: true
```

When you click a piece:
```
[dragstart] Drag started on object
[dragstart] Piece 5 drag started successfully
```

## Testing

1. **Reload the page** to clear any cached state
2. **Watch the browser console** for the debug logs
3. **Wait for explosion to complete** - should see "All X pieces settled"
4. **Try dragging pieces** - should see "drag started" messages
5. **Check the physics toggle** - should work in both modes

## Performance Note

The debug logging uses conditional logging (1.6% chance per frame) for progress updates to avoid console spam. This has negligible performance impact. The logs can be removed later if desired.

## Files Modified

- `/ClientApp/src/game/puzzle.scene.ts`:
  - `updateExplosionWithMatter()`: Relaxed settling thresholds, added logging
  - `preparePiecesForPuzzle()`: Added logging for draggable state
  - `setupDragHandlers()`: Added logging for drag events

## Why This Fixes the Issue

1. **Pieces can now settle realistically**: Matter.js physics allows natural resting states
2. **Explosion actually completes**: More lenient thresholds ensure all pieces eventually settle
3. **Puzzle phase starts**: `preparePiecesForPuzzle()` gets called as intended
4. **Pieces become draggable**: `setDraggable()` is called on all pieces
5. **Debugging is easier**: Console logs show exactly what's happening

## Additional Notes

The original thresholds (`0.01`) were designed for the custom physics system, which had deterministic, predictable movement. Matter.js introduces realistic physics with:
- Friction and air resistance (gradual slowdown)
- Collisions with other pieces (unpredictable velocities)
- Bouncing and rotation (complex motion)

These make it much harder to reach near-zero velocities, especially when pieces are stacked on top of each other or settling into gaps.

The new thresholds (`0.05`) still ensure pieces are "basically stationary" but account for the natural variance in Matter.js simulations.
